                <h2>Bob Zellner</h2>
                <p>
                    Bob Zellner brings to life the victories, struggles and heartbreaks of the Civil Rights era in a way that empowers and instructs audiences and the modern-day movement. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bob is one of the most influential leaders in the Civil Rights Movement, from the 1960s to today. The son and grandson of Ku Klux Klan members, 
                    he risked his life – and nearly lost it – many times in the fight to achieve The Second Emancipation. As an organizer of The Freedom Rides of 1961 
                    and the first white southerner to serve as field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, he worked alongside Martin Luther King, Jr., 
                    John Lewis, Rosa Parks and many other civil rights leaders. Famous for battles with the KKK, segregationist lynch mobs, and violent police, 
                    he is now the individual that a new generation turns to with questions on the racial, historical and cultural assumptions on which they were raised, 
                    as they ask themselves, "What is my place in this struggle?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bob presents a modern-day message for combating deep-seated racism, discrimination and prejudice and sparking widespread social change.

                <h2>Pamela Smith</h2>
                <p>
                    Elizabeth Pamela Smith’s life path has been a quest for ultimate truth. Pamela is driven by the desire to elevate her human consciousness, in order to have the capacity to create health and well being for all life. 

 

                    “How can we create a world that widely benefits all life on earth?”

                    

                    In 1971 Pamela was a founding member of The Farmin Summertown Tennessee - an intentional spiritual community. The Farm’s founding members were predominately white, educated youth who rejected the norms, dogma and racism of their materialistic culture. Their dream was to create a healthy vegetarian community in tune with nature’s processes and raise human consciousness. 

                    

                    The Farm established a relief organization, Plenty. In 1976, Plenty partnered with Canada to assist in Guatemala’s recovery.  Pamela’s young family, along with midwives, nurses, carpenters, mechanics and their families traveled to Guatemala to provide medical relief and build schools after a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake took 23,000 lives.  Plenty International is still active in Guatemala, Belize, the Caribbean and continues to assist the Oglala Lakota on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation.

                    

                    Pamela advocates for the health care benefits to mothers and babies of natural childbirth and midwifery.  The Farm community established a school of midwifery during the 1970’s that continues to offer, Midwife assisted natural birth on The Farm in Summertown, Tennessee.

                    

                    As a Medical Assistant and Doula Pamela established a business in Boulder, Colorado from 1990 to 1998 called Wee Care. Her company assisted mother’s during birth and provided postpartum care for new mothers and their families. 

                    

                    Bob Zellner And Pamela met and fell in love at the Black Hills Unity Concert in Solidarity with Standing Rock. The mutual concern and advocacy they share for their First Nation brothers and sisters was the tie that bound them.

                    

                    Bob and Pamela travel across the United States speaking at schools, universities and churches.  Bob is a civil rights historians traveling with  Project Pilgrimage, an educational project out of Seattle Washington, with young people and adults from the University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest, traveling to places in the deep South where often horrific events changed the course of our national history. Bob was a part of that history.
